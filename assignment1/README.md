This is a simple Python program built using OpenCV that allows users to perform basic image operations through a menu-driven interface. The user can:

- Display the original image.
- Convert the image to grayscale and display it.
- Save the grayscale version of the image with a custom filename and format.

It is an introductory project for practicing image processing concepts with OpenCV and handling user input in Python.
